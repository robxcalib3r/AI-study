A governor is a component that is used to control the performance and behavior of a subprogram or system. It is often used to ensure that the subprogram or system operates within certain limits, such as a maximum speed or load, and to prevent it from overloading or malfunctioning.

general steps to build governor:
1. Identify the parameters that need to be controlled.
2. Determine the desired operating limits.
3. Select the control strategy.
	-  To regulate the performance the sub programs.
	-  Input is adjusted based on a predicted output.
	- might require feedback or feedforward loop.
4. Test and calibrate the governor.


### Possible Ideas
1. Feedback loop
2. PID controllers
3. Machine learning controller.
