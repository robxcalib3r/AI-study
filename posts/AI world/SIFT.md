Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is a local feature descriptor that is commonly used in computer vision and image processing applications.
It is designed to extract distinctive features from an image, such as edges, corners, and textures, that are robust to geometric and photometric changes, such as changes in scale, orientation, and illumination.

SIFT works by first detecting a set of scale-invariant keypoints in the image, which are points of interest that are stable under changes in scale and orientation. It then extracts a set of features, called descriptor vectors, from the image around each keypoint. These descriptor vectors are computed based on the gradient orientation histograms of the image within a local region around the keypoint, and they are designed to be invariant to changes in scale, orientation, and illumination.

- can be computationally expensive and may not perform as well as more advanced algorithms such as SURF or deep learning-based approaches on certain tasks.
