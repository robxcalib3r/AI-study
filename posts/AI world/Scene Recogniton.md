Scene recognition is a computer vision task that involves identifying and classifying the objects and features present in an image or video sequence. Scene recognition algorithms typically use machine learning techniques to analyze the visual content of an image and classify it into predefined categories such as "beach," "mountain," "office," etc.

- Algorithms
	1. [[Bag-of-words (BoW) model]]: This is a simple and widely used algorithm for scene recognition. It involves representing an image as a histogram of visual words, which are obtained by clustering the image features using k-means clustering. The BoW model is fast and efficient, but it has limited discriminative power and may not perform well on complex or diverse scenes.
	3.  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): CNNs are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. They can learn hierarchical representations of image features and are able to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of scene recognition benchmarks.
	4. Spatial pyramid matching (SPM): This algorithm represents an image as a pyramid of spatial bins, with each bin containing a histogram of features. The features are typically extracted using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) or speeded up robust features (SURF). The SPM algorithm is able to capture both global and local image features, and has achieved good performance on scene recognition tasks.
	5. Fisher vector (FV): The FV algorithm is a variant of the BoW model that uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to model the distribution of image features. It represents an image as a weighted sum of the GMM components, which can capture more discriminative information than the BoW model. The FV algorithm has achieved good performance on scene recognition tasks, but it can be computationally expensive.
	6. Local binary patterns (LBP): This is a simple and efficient algorithm that represents an image as a set of local binary patterns, which are obtained by thresholding the image pixels based on their intensity values. The LBP algorithm has achieved good performance on scene recognition tasks, especially when combined with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.


- Approaches
	1. Feature-based approaches: These algorithms extract a set of distinctive features from the image or video frame, such as edges, corners, textures, or color histograms, and use them to classify the scene.
	2. Machine learning-based approaches: These algorithms use machine learning techniques, such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), or neural networks, to learn how to classify scenes based on a set of labeled training examples.
	3. Hybrid approaches: These algorithms combine elements of both feature-based and machine learning-based approaches to achieve improved performance.
